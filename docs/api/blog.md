You’re an iOS developer. Maybe you’ve been doing it for a while, or maybe you’re new to the scene. Maybe you prefer to think of yourself as an “iOS engineer,” because it sounds better and no one seems to agree on whether there’s a difference. Whatever the situation: you’re feeling restless. You’ve worked on interesting projects before — successful ones, even — and you recognize that getting paid to do what you do is in many ways a privilege. Nonetheless, you can’t shake the feeling that none of the work you’ve done is truly yours. Much of your time has been spent helping others achieve their goals — and that’s okay! — but you increasingly feel like you’ve got some of your own goals to chase too.
