### See Nearby Bus Stops

Anywhere you go, you can see if nearby bus stops and buses that operate on that bus stop.

You can even browse bus stops on a map, if you find \"The One\", just click on it :). This is only available on the Android app though.

### Widgets

Want to see arrival timings of your starred buses directly on your home screen or arrival timings of a bus at a bus stop. Use widgets that come bundled with the iOS app, free of charge :)
